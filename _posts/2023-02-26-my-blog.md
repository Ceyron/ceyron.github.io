This is my new website and blog. I am still working on it, but it is already online. I will post more information about it soon.

Quick test on the math mode: $\int_0^1 x^2 dx$ inline

and full line:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 dx
$$

And the code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
y = x**2

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```
