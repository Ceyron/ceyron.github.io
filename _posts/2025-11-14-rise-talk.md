I had the honor to be invited to the [RISE ML seminar
series](https://www.ri.se/en/learningmachinesseminars/felix-kohler-from-numerical-simulators-of-pdes-to-neural-emulators-and-back)
and speak about my current research. You can find the [recording
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olpXyDARMJI&list=PLqLiVcF3GKy1tuQFoDu5QKOM6S33t_4R1&index=1)
and the [slides
here](https://fkoehler.site/files/from_numerical_simulators_to_neural_emulators_and_back_at_RISE.pdf).

In it, I build a bigger narrative arc around the results from
[APEBench](https://tum-pbs.github.io/apebench-paper/) and my recent NeurIPS 2025
paper on [Neural Emulator Superiority](https://tum-pbs.github.io/emulator-superiority/).

Below is the abstract of the talk:

> The potential for computational speedups and tackling unsolved problems has
> motivated the use of neural networks (NNs) for helping solve PDEs. In
> particular, image-like models that operate on state-discrete representations
> that approach time autoregressively gained popularity over the past years.
>
> In this talk, I will present a holistic perspective on learning autoregressive
> neural emulators from simulated data, starting with the synthetic data
> generation using classical numerical simulators, covering the training process
> and ultimately investigating their benchmarking. Using a wide range of
> experiments with different PDEs and neural architectures, I will highlight the
> similarities between emulators and simulators. This shows how emulator
> architectures were inspired by classical schemes for solving the laws of
> nature and thereby inherit both their merits and limitations. 
>
> Moreover, I will elaborate on the impact of reference data fidelity and
> discuss a counterintuitive yet interesting finding when emulators can become
> better than their training data source.
