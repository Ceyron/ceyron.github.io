### Bio

If you need a five-sentence bio about me:


> Felix Koehler is a fourth-year PhD student at the Technical University of Munich under the supervision of Prof. Nils Thuerey. His research interests span numerical simulations of PDEs, reduced-order models, neural emulators, optimization theory, automatic differentiation, and adjoint methods. In particular, he is interested in discovering deep insights into neural networks solving physics problems, e.g., in fluid or structural mechanics. He holds an M.Sc. in Computational Science & Engineering from TUM. Besides research, he works on free educational material covering Machine Learning & Simulation on his YouTube channel.
