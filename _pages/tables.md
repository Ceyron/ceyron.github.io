## Tables on Automatic Differentiation

* [Overview of Explicit Automatic Differentiation Rules](/autodiff-table) for both scalar and tensor operations (forward- and reverse-mode)
* [Overview of Implicit Automatic Differentiation Rules](/implicit-autodiff-table) like root-finding, (non-)linear system solving, ODE and PDE integration or differentiable optimization (forward- and reverse-mode)

## Tables on Physics-based deep learning

* [Overview of learning setups for neural predictors](/predictor-learning-setups) like the classical t-step supervised, but also more that involve differentiable physics simulators
