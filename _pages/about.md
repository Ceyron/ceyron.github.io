I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich,
supervised by [Prof. Nils Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/) and funded by the
[Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). My research is on
differentiable physics simulators, neural emulators for PDEs and optimization
theory. During my PhD, I interned at Meta Reality Labs in Zurich supervised by
[Ryan Goldade](https://rgoldade.github.io/).

Before the PhD, I studied [Computational Science and Engineering
(CSE)](https://www.in.tum.de/en/in/fuer-studieninteressierte/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/)
at TU Munich with a focus on applied numerical methods, high-performance
computing and machine learning. During this time, I was fortunate to be
supervised by [Dr. Dirk Hartmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirkhartmann)
while conducting industrial machine learning research at Siemens Technology as
part of my working student position and master thesis. Initially, I studied
Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Braunschweig from which I
graduated with a bachelor thesis on explicit-adaptive finite volume solvers
supervised by [Dr. Fabian
Sewerin](https://www.mvt.ovgu.de/People/Dr_+Fabian+Sewerin.html).

I strongly believe in open science and open education which is why I created the
YouTube channel [Machine Learning &
Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/@MachineLearningSimulation) to cover
advanced mathematical topics I am passionate about.
